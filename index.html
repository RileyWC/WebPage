        <p>
          Hi, My name is Riley Conners. I am a computer science student at UMass Lowell
          with an educational focus on data science as well as cybersecurity. I am 
          currently working towards my master's degree in cybersecurity also at UMass Lowell. 
          When I am not at school, I like to get outdoors and stay active. I 
          enjoy running and hiking primarily, but I also love to bike and kayak. Some 
          of my more leisurely hobbies include playing pool, PC and Raspberry Pi projects,
          ham radio, and fixing whatever IT/Internet problems my friends and family run 
          into :)
        </p>

        <h2>Education:</h2>
        <h4>B.S. in Computer Science: Cybersecurity & Data Science Concentration (May 2025)<br>
        University of Massachusetts Lowell <br>
        Mathematics Minor | 3.818 GPA</h4>
        <p>
          I attended the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Lowell from 2021-2025 to
          earn my bachelor's degree in computer science alongside a minor in mathematics. My 
          educational focus was on cybersecurity and data science, which means I took classes
          revolving around data communication protocols, computer & network security, 
          cyber-crime, artificial intelligence, and more. 
        </p>
        <p>
          During my bachelor's degree at UMass Lowell I participated in many extra 
          curricular clubs and activities. I spent some time with the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, 
          ACM, Robotics, and Cybersecurity Clubs. I also took part in some of the activities
          run by the honors college, and I started earning my Intelligence Community (IC) 
          Scholar status by taking intelligence related courses and by attending meetings
          and presentations outside of class. On top of this, I also participated in the Collegiate
          Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) in my junior year, where UMass Lowell placed 3rd
          in the region. This competition involves a team of 8 defending a simulated corrupted
          infrastructure from attackers over a 2 day period. More information  
          <a href="https://www.nationalccdc.org/index.php">here.</a>
        </p>

        <h4>M.S. in Security Studies: Cybersecurity Concentration (Expected December 2025)<br>
        University of Massachusetts Lowell <br>
        IC Scholar Status Earned |  TBD GPA </h4>

        <p>
          As a part of the bachelor's to master's program at UMass Lowell, I took classes during
          my senior year of my bachelors degree and continued taking classes over the summer and
          fall of 2025 to earn my Master's Degree (Expected 12/2025) in Security
          Studies with a focus on Cybersecurity. This involved me taking more in-depth classes
          revolving around current cybersecurity issues like ransomware and modern mobile networks
          as well as intelligence topics like technology's role in intelligence, intelligence 
          collection & analysis, and national security. This is also when I completed my status 
          as an IC Scholar at UMass Lowell. More information about the program can be found 
          <a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/iccae">here.</a>

        <h2>Projects:</h2>
        <p>
          I have completed a fair amount of projects for the coursework during my bachelor's degree
          which include making a spam email detection algorithm using bayes theorem, using Markov
          chains to mimic authors' writing styles, making sarcasm detecting models for news headlines, 
          creating a command line version of airdrop with encryption, and making basic web servers.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of my classes I have completed some personal projects as well. I built my first PC 
          in 2022 and used it to help with my coursework and other personal projects on my home network.
          I used Raspberry Pis for most of my personal projects from a PiHole DNS server and ad blocker,
          to a PiVPN server that let me SSH into my machines from anywhere. I also used a Pi to make a
          retro gaming console for trips, and one even runs this website as a TOR Hidden Service.
        </p>

        <h2>Hiking & Running:</h2>
        <p>
          For fun I enjoy running and hiking. I have recently run a few marathons and enjoy participating
          in a local weekly 5k race series in the summer and winter. I also like to do a lot of hiking. 
          Currently I am visiting the fire towers in New Hampshire, and I plan on doing the 48 4000 footers
          and 52 with a view locations in NH. I also plan to attempt the Appalachian Trail in the future.
