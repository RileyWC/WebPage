        <p>
          Hi, My name is Riley Conners. I am a computer science student at UMass Lowell
          with an educational focus on data science as well as cybersecurity. I am 
          currently working towards my master's degree in cybersecurity at UMass Lowell
          as well. When I am not at school, I like to get outdoors and stay active. I 
          enjoy running and hiking primarily, but I also love to bike and kayak. Some 
          of my more leisurely hobbies include playing pool, PC and Raspberry Pi projects,
          ham radio, and fixing whatever IT/Internet problems my friends and family run 
          into :)
        </p>

        <!--Education-->
        <div>
        <h2>Education:</h2>
        <p>
          I attended the University of Massachusetts Lowell from 2021-2025 to
          earn my bachelor's degree in computer science alongside a minor in mathematics. My 
          educational focus was on cybersecurity and data science, which means I took classes
          revolving around data communication protocols, computer & network security, 
          cyber-crime, artificial intelligence, and more. 
        </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          During the completion of my bachelor's degree I participated in many extra 
          curricular clubs and activities. I spent some time with the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, 
          ACM, Robotics, and Cybersecurity Clubs, as well as participated in the Collegiate
          Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) in my junior year, where UMass Lowell placed 3rd
          in the region. I also took part in some of the activities run by the honors college,
          and I am earning my IC Scholar status by taking intelligence related courses and by
          attending meetings and presentations outside of class.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am currently working towards my master's degree in cybersecurity studies, also
          at UMass Lowell. This program has classes on cyber crime, systems and network security, 
          forensics, intrusion detection and auditing, intelligence, designing secure systems, and 
          cybersecurity's role in national security. I currently plan to earn this degree by the 
          end of the fall 2025 semester.
        </p>


        <h2>Projects:</h2>
        <p>
          I have completed a fair amount of projects for the coursework during my bachelor's degree
          which include making a spam email detection algorithm using bayes theorem, using Markov
          chains to mimic authors' writing styles, making sarcasm detecting models for news headlines, 
          creating a command line version of airdrop with encryption, and making basic web servers.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of my classes I have completed some personal projects as well. I built my first PC 
          in 2022 and used it to help with my coursework and other personal projects on my home network.
          I used Raspberry Pis for most of my personal projects from a PiHole DNS server and ad blocker,
          to a PiVPN server that let me SSH into my machines from anywhere. I also used a Pi to make a
          retro gaming console for trips, and one even runs this website as a TOR Hidden Service.
        </p>

        <h2>Hiking & Running:</h2>
        <p>
          For fun I enjoy running and hiking. I have recently run a few marathons and enjoy participating
          in a local weekly 5k race series in the summer and winter. I also like to do a lot of hiking. 
          Currently I am visiting the fire towers in New Hampshire, and I plan on doing the 48 4000 footers
          and 52 with a view locations in NH. I also plan to attempt the Appalachian Trail in the future.
